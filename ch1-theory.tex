\section{Access to $\Delta G$}

The polarized gluon density affects a affects a wide variety of observables,
and a rich experimental and computational program has developed over the past
few decades to strictly constrain it. The first experimental constraints on
\(\Delta G\) were obtained through measurements of the variation with \(Q^2\)
at fixed \(x\) of the \(g_1\) structure functions, while more recent
measurements in polarized DIS have focused on the photon-gluon fusion channel
that is directly sensitive to polarized glue. The results in this thesis rely
on a complementary and unique experimental program of polarized proton
collisions, where the partonic interactions frequently involve one or more
gluons in the initial state.
