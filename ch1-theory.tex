\section{Access to $\Delta G$}

The polarized gluon density affects a affects a wide variety of observables
and a rich experimental and computational program has developed over the past
few decades to strictly constrain it. The first experimental constraints on
$\Delta g$ were obtained through measurements of the variation with $Q^2$ at
fixed $X$ of the $g_1$ structure functions, while more recent measurements in
polarized DIS have focused on the photon-gluon fusion channel that is directly
sensitive to polarized glue. Lattice QCD calculations ... . Finally,
collisions of polarized proton beams ... .
