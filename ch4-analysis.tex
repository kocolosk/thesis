\chapter{Analysis}

The analysis encompasses data taken during the 2005 and 2006 RHIC runs when
the polarized proton beams were longitudinally polarized and colliding at a
center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV. Spin asymmetries are constructed using
charged pions produced at mid-rapidity and having large transverse momentum.

% \subsection{Polarization Vectors and Transverse Asymmetries}

% data selection - 1/2 day

% pion identification - 1 day

% jet reconstruction - 1 day

% jet/pion correlations - 1/2 day.  Just a plot of the dphi matching in data and simulation ought to be enough.

% Systematic Uncertanties

% nothing for PID, but will i need to redo the run 6 analysis to subtract backgrounds? yes.  Can I assume nSigmaPion does not need to be recalibrated? probably - 4 days

% 2006 trigger bias includes the minbias Monte Carlo reweighting hackery - 2 days

% but not just the reweighting hackery, there's also an uncertainty in the size of the jet pT shift - 1 day.  And why don't I include pion pt shifts in that calculation?  Is it because I choose bin widths to match the pion pT resolution?

% Results - 1 day

% Conclusions - 1.5 days

% Cleanup - 2 days
