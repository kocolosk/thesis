\chapter{Analysis}

The analysis encompasses data taken during the 2005 and 2006 RHIC runs when
the polarized proton beams were longitudinally polarized and colliding at a
center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV. Spin asymmetries are constructed using
charged pions produced at mid-rapidity and having large transverse momentum.
