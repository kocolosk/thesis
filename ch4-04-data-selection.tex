\section{Data Selection}


% Run Selection


% Event Quality Cuts
% - use the best reconstructed vertex for the event.  If no vertex was reconstructed, skip the event
% - identified spin states for the colliding bunches in both beams
% - vertex position from scaler timing information falls within a window

% Track Quality Cuts

% Jet Quality Cuts

% description of QA procedure? (essentially jet QA)

% final sampled luminosity (and FOM, or is that the next section?) covered in this analysis

% drift velocity correction?  that could be cool to include, since I did it.  Or not.
