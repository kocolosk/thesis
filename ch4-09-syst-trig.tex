\subsection{Trigger Bias}

% intro paragraph describing common sources of trigger and reco bias?

This source of systematic uncertainty is evaluated using a leading-order Monte
Carlo simulation of \(A_{LL}\) known as the Method of Asymmetry Weights. Pythia
supplies the kinematics and hard scattering subprocess of each simulated event,
which are sufficient to determine the partonic \(a_{LL}\) (calculated at NLO in
\cite{}). An ``asymmetry weight'' for the event is then constructed by
statistically sampling parton distribution functions:
%
\begin{equation}
  w = \frac{\Delta f_1(x_1, Q^2) * \Delta f_2(x_2, Q^2) * a_{LL}}{f_1(x_1, Q^2) * f_2(x_2, Q^2)},
\end{equation}
%
and one arrives at a Monte Carlo \(A_{LL}\) by simply taking the ratio of
asymmetry-weighted and unweighted distributions. The difference between the
``true'' \(A_{LL}\) for all Pythia events and the ``reconstructed'' \(A_{LL}\)
for events that satisfy a simulated trigger condition is used to assign the
systematic uncertainty.

This procedure requires that the Monte Carlo generator accurately reproduces the real event kinematics. Unfortunately, the fragmentation tune in Pythia 6.4 is not quite up to the task for STAR. Figure~\ref{fig:subprocess-fractions} is a comparison of the subprocess contributions to charged pion production reported by Pythia with the results of NLO pQCD calculations incorporating Kretzer and DSS fragmentation functions. The DSS set is known to better describe RHIC kinematics, but in Figure~\ref{fig:subprocess-fractions} it's clear that Pythia agrees much better with Kretzer.

  \label{fig:subprocess-fractions}
\end{figure}

An accurate simulation of the subprocess contributions is an important
precondition for using the Method of Asymmetry Weights to evaluate trigger and
reconstruction bias, quite simply because $A_{LL}$ has such a strong subprocess
dependence. To confirm that the problem is really isolated to Pythia's
fragmentation functions, we examined the ratio of pions fragmenting from the
quark and the gluon in \(qg\) scattering events. That ratio is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:qg-fragmentation}, and confirms that the fragmentation model is
Kretzer-like, with much softer gluon fragmentation and/or harder quark
fragmentation than is observed at RHIC.

% the reweighting factor is the ratio of DSS and Kretzer FFs in each pT bin

% this reweighting factor is not applied in the 2006 analysis at the moment

Rather than plumb the depths of Pythia's independent fragmentation model, this
analysis applied a $p_{T}$- and subprocess-dependent reweighting factor to the
simulations to generate DSS-like fragmentation. The effect of this reweighting
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:compare-mcasym-nlo}. The filled markers show
markedly better agreement with the NLO pQCD calculations than the open markers,
particularly in scenarios such as GRSV-MIN where the difference in $A_{LL}$
between gg and qg subprocesses is large. The agreement is still not perfect; one
might speculate that Pythia gives too much weight to favored quark
fragmentation, since at high $p_{T}$ the $\pi^{-}$ asymmetries are too small
(indicating a relatively large d quark contribution) and the $\pi^{+}$
asymmetries are too large (consistent with a large u quark contribution).
However, as the trigger and reconstruction are not expected to be quark flavor
dependent we have decided to press forward with these simulations.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/compare-mcasym-nlo}
  \caption{Comparison of Monte Carlo asymmetries with NLO pQCD calculations
  incorporating DSS fragmentation functions. The open markers show results
  obtained using STAR's Pythia tune. The filled markers show the change in the
  asymmetries after reweighting the gg, qg, and qq distributions by the ratio
  of subprocess fractions calculated using DSS and Kretzer fragmentation
  functions.}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mcasym-diff} examines the difference between asymmetries for a
``true'' sample using untriggered events and pions pulled straight from the
Pythia record, and a ``trigger+reco'' sample where the events must satisfy the
JP2 trigger simulator and the pion kinematics are obtained from TPC track
reconstruction. In some cases, the difference between the two samples is smaller
than the uncertainty on the ``trigger+reco'' sample (see Figure
\ref{fig:mcasym-sigma}). The systematic is assigned as the larger of the
difference in central values and the uncertainty on the ``trigger+reco'' sample.

The size of the systematic obviously depends on the polarized gluon
distributions that are included in the analysis. Previous measurements have
excluded the maximal polarization scenarios as well as scenarios with the
functional form of the GRSV set and integral gluon polarizations larger than
STD. As a result, we use an envelope defined by the GRSV M105 and STD
scenarios. The results of this analysis are shown in Table
\ref{tbl:trig-reco-bias}.
