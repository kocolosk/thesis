\subsection{Photon-Gluon Fusion}

Given the relatively small lever arm in $Q^2$ currently available to constrain
$\Delta G$ via evolution of $g_1$, it is natural to pursue a more direct
approach involving observables that are directly linked to the gluon
polarization. In photon-gluon fusion (PGF), the lepton emits a real or virtual
photon that interacts with a gluon radiated from the nucleon to produce a
$q\bar{q}$ pair (see Figure \ref{fig:pgf}). PGF is a rare process compared to
scattering off of quarks in the nucleon, and as such analyses need a way to
enhance the signal to background ratio. The golden signature for PGF is charm
in the final state, since the nucleon itself has a negligible charm content.
Charm production has a small cross section, so analyses that look for
high-$p_T$ final states are also common.

Figure \ref{fig:pgf-deltag} summarizes results for the gluon polarization
extracted at leading order from analyses of photon-gluon fusion processes.
SMC, HERMES, and COMPASS have all released results based on the detection of
high-$p_T$ hadrons or jets, and COMPASS has released a single data point from
an analysis of charmed ($D^0$ and $D^*$) mesons. The data cover an $x$ range
of approximately $0.07 < \langle x \rangle < 0.2$ and restrict the magnitude
of the gluon polarization within that region. No NLO analysis of PGF data on
$\Delta G$ is currently available.

% ... this is wrong, the number is just for the COMPASS open charm measurement, the most recent LO global analysis from COMPASS yields $\Delta g(x)/g(x) = -0.49~\pm~0.27~(stat)~\pm~0.11~(syst)$ at a scale $\mu^2 \sim 13~(GeV/c)^2$ and at an average gluon momentum fraction $\langle x \rangle ~\sim 0.11$ \cite{Alekseev:2009ey}.
