\subsection{Scaling Violations in parton densities}

QCD introduces a \(Q^2\) dependence into the parton distribution functions which is calculable using the evolution equations
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{d~\Delta q(x,Q^2)}{d~ln Q^2} &=& \frac{\alpha_s}{2 \pi} \left[ \Delta P_{qq} \otimes \Delta q + \Delta P_{qg} \otimes \Delta g \right] \nonumber \\
  \frac{d~\Delta g(x,Q^2)}{d~ln Q^2} &=& \frac{\alpha_s}{2 \pi} \left[ \Delta P_{gq} \otimes \Delta q + \Delta P_{gg} \otimes \Delta g \right].
\end{eqnarray}
%
The \(\Delta P\) are polarized splitting functions calculated perturbatively in \(\alpha_s\).  The original parton model equation for \(g_1\) \ref{eqn:simple-g1} becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  g_1(x, Q^2) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j} e_j^2 \left[\Delta q_j^2 + \Delta \bar{q}_j^2 + \frac{\alpha_s}{2 \pi} \left(\Delta C_j \otimes \left[\Delta q_j + \Delta \bar{q}_j\right] + \Delta C_g \otimes \Delta g\right)\right].
  \label{eqn:enhanced-g1}
\end{equation}
%
where the sum is over flavors and the \(\Delta C_j\) are Wilson coefficients. Given measurements of \(g_1\) at a fixed value of \(x\) and varying \(Q^2\), one can use \ref{eqn:enhanced-g1} to solve for the polarized gluon density. The  technique has proven very effective in unpolarized DIS, where a mix of fixed-target and collider data provides precise measurements of the structure functions across five decades in \(Q^2\) --- an excellent ``lever arm'' for the evolution equations.  In contrast, Figure \ref{fig:g1-versus-q2} plots the current world data on \(g_1\).  Extractions of \(\Delta g(x)\) from these fixed-target data are prone to significant uncertainties.  An example analysis from Leader, Sidorov, and Stamenov is shown in Figure \ref{fig:g1-deltag}; in that analysis, even the sign of the gluon polarization is not constrained by the data. The proposed Electron Ion Collider (EIC), a polarized analogue to HERA, would augment the current data on \(g_1\) with a broad range of high \(Q^2\) measurements and thus dramatically improve the constraints on polarized structure functions obtained through \(g_1\) evolution.
