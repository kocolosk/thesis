\section{Triggering and Data Acquisition}

The basic building block of nearly all physics analyses in the 200 GeV pp program is the minimum-bias (MB) trigger defined by coincident signals in the East and West BBCs, yielding a sensitivity of 26.1$\pm$2.0 mb (87\%) of the NSD cross section as deduced from a Vernier scan performed in 2003. On top of the MB trigger STAR layers a variety of requirements based on signals in the electromagnetic calorimeters that bias the event sample towards rare events with large transverse energy depositions.

The dominant trigger algorithm in this analysis is the BEMC jet patch (JP) trigger, which sums transverse energy depositions over fixed groups of 400 towers covering an area of $\Delta \eta \times \Delta \phi$ = 1.0 $\times$ 1.0.  The JP trigger is designed for efficient, minimally-biased selection of high-energy jets.  The threshold for the primary JP trigger in the 2005(2006) run was 6.4(8.3) GeV, and the trigger sampled an integrated luminosity during longitudinal running of 3.3(8.3) $pb^{-1}$.

% The 8.3 number excludes transverse running.  Including that the 06 number would be 1.95 (1st long) + 3.20 (trans) + 6.30 (2nd long) = 11.45
% also assumes a MB cross section of 25 mb, not 26.1 as stated here

% my thresholds assume final calibrations, I think

% Jamie's integrated lumi numbers are somewhat smaller than mine, presumably because of some basic quality cuts.  My numbers for 06 BJP1 are

% 137221 0.1
% 137222 6.8

% for a total sampled lumi from longitudinal running of 9.3, rather than 8.3
